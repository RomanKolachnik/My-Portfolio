## My Role

I worked as a **Gameplay Programmer** on this project, responsible for core systems including:

- Local multiplayer input using Unity’s Input System
- Combat mechanics for 9 unique characters with special moves
- Chain attack system to encourage team synergy
- AI behavior for wild creatures with personalities and obstacle avoidance
- Custom Unity editor tools for environment set-dressing (e.g., auto-grounding, sorters)

## Features I Developed

### Local Multiplayer Input
![Input Setup](assets/goofy-lil-guys/input.gif)  
Using Unity’s new Input System, I configured dynamic controller detection and split input between multiple players sharing the same screen. Each controller was linked to a specific player prefab.

### AI Personalities
![Creature AI](assets/goofy-lil-guys/creature-ai.gif)  
Wild creatures have different personalities (aggressive, cautious, curious) using a lightweight FSM and steering behaviors to avoid obstacles, engage in combat, or retreat.

### Editor Tools
![Editor Tools](assets/goofy-lil-guys/editor-tool.png)  
To help designers speed up level-building, I created tools to:
- Auto-ground objects to terrain
- Tag and sort props
- Apply batch adjustments to collider settings
